This Folder Contains Codes and Proof of Simulation Results of
8051 Based Mini Projects Written In assembly Language

whose problem statement were as follows: 

Use 8051 micro-controller family. Programming should be done in Assembly or C language (Keil).
1. Interface Switch and LEDs with any micro-controller. Update LED pattern according to switch positions.
2. Interface push button. Toggle LED when button is pressed. Use interrupt method to detect push button event (do not poll button value).

In my simulation the 8051 selected by me was AT89C51
