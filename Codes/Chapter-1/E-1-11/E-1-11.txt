Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Ans:

Typically words for humans means a combination of alphabets where as the definition of
word given by the program is a collection of alphanumeric as well special symbol characters
that are seprated from each other via "\n" or " " or "\t" hence as long as human interpreta
tion of the word is considered the program contains bugs because it can identify only based
on the above mentioned definition of word and hence for program the following examples are
also words

123->word
1abc->word
...///$$%^->word

hence above collection of characters cannot be considered as words for us and hence program
may seem buggy in this aspect because of its definition
